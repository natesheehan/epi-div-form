Epistemic diversity encompasses a variety of perspectives, approaches, and traditions that can be brought to bear on open science research  ( [Leonelli 2021](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/19817/)). Epistemic Diversity can refer to different disciplinary approaches or methods and can also refer to different ontologies, assumptions, and perspectives that guide research. We define Epistemic Diversity as "_the
condition or fact of being different or varied, which affects the development and/or understanding of knowledge_". The following form is designed to extract information regarding the epistemic diversity of an open science project based on five categories: Material, Conceptual, Methodological, Infrastructural, Socio-Cultural, and Institutional.

## Conceptual
The conceptual diversity of open science is evident in the variety of ways that scientists can approach and understand problems. This includes different theoretical frameworks, models, and approaches that can be used to better understand the world around us. Use this section to write up to 250 words generalising the contextual aspects of the project.

## Socio-Cultural
The socio-cultural diversity of open science is evident in the variety of people and groups that are involved in open science activities. This includes different disciplines, institutions, and communities that contribute to the advancement of open science.

## Material
The diversity of open science is evident in the variety of materials that are available for use. This includes data sets, code, and other digital resources that can be accessed and used by anyone.

1. What is the source of the data?
2. Under what agreement is the data open to the public?
3. Is the data available in a machine-readable format?

8. Is there a process in place to ensure the quality of the data?
9. Are there mechanisms in place to allow for feedback and input from users?

## Infrastructural
The infrastructural diversity of open science is evident in the variety of tools and platforms that are available for use. This includes different software applications, hardware systems, and networks that can be used to better support open science practices.
### Funding
